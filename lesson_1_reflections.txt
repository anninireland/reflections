How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped by showing which lines the error might be on by isolating those that are different between versions 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Being able to access older versions would be helpful not only in bug fixing, 
	but also in retrieving old versions of a file to get the previous functionality 
	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    typical uses of google docs will only require tracking one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to find commits, then use git diff to compare 2 commits 
	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This is awesome! I'm totally looking forward to using this!! 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I think Git will come in handy for tracking changes to the projects I am working on... 
	I need a bit more practice first though
